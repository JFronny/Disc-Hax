### Features
Read [this](https://jfronny.github.io/Disc-Hax) for a somewhat complete list of features (that page is updated automatically by MDExtractor, see https://github.com/JFronny/Disc-Hax/tree/master/MDExtractor)

### Projects in this Repository
The main projects are "Shared" (somewhat reusable snippets, independent from the actual bot code for better structure) and "Bot" (the main bot project)

There is also MDExtractor. This is used to generate the documentation with reflection. MDExtractor is executed with [this](https://github.com/JFronny/Disc-Hax/blob/master/.github/workflows/docs.yml) script after any push

All other projects are experiments for some features. They are stand-alone projects that can be ran independently from other projects
